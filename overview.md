# "Premise"

## Overview

__*Premise*__ is a collaborative story-telling platform on which people can
create and explore multiple worlds of branching narratives, where the branches
of each world grow from a shared central premise.

## Target audience

__*Premise*__ primarily targets individuals who enjoy:

* Collaborative worldbuilding and storytelling
* Canon-based literature, such as the *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter*,
    and *Star Wars* series.
* Creating and consuming fanfiction
* Exploring the 'butterly effect', where a small change within any given moment
    can lead to very different futures.

## Structure

The fundamental unit within __*Premise*__ is a __'moment'__ - a user-created
  piece of text, no more than 200 characters long, that are strung together to
  create an overall narrative. Each individual __moment__ may be a snippet of
  dialogue, exposition, description, narrative, etc.

__Moments__ are the individual nodes that form a __'story network'__ - an
  interconnected web of narratives. With a __story network__, each __moment__ has
  a single __'parent moment'__, and may have any number of __'child moments'__.
  In this way, __moments__ combine to create branching stories, in which the
  narrative can proceed in any number of directions at each step.

At the core of every __story network__ sits a central __'premise'__ - a set of
5 __moments__ connected in a ring. __Premises__ are designed to 'set the scene' for
a __story network__. For example, a __premise__ might:

* Describe the high-level geography and politics of a fictional world.
* Describe a murder scene.
* Introduce several characters, all gathered in a village pub.

A __premise__ thus creates a central concept or setting, from which any number
  of branching narratives may emerge. The individual narratives, in effect,
  create parallel universes in which the core concept remains the same, but
  every other element is up for grabs.
  
For example, the aforementioned 'murder scene premise' could have two different
  story branches that focused on entirely different motives. Or one could follow
  a single story branch all the way to the moment the mystery is solved, and
  then follow two diverging branches that named entirely different suspects!
