# "Premise"

## Overview

__*Premise*__ is a collaborative story-telling platform on which people can
create and explore multiple worlds of branching narratives, where the branches
of each world grow from a shared central premise.

## Target audience

__*Premise*__ primarily targets individuals who enjoy:

* Collaborative worldbuilding and storytelling
* Canon-based literature, such as the *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter*,
    and *Star Wars* series.
* Creating and consuming fanfiction
* Exploring the 'butterly effect', where a small change within any given moment
    can lead to very different futures.

## Structure

The fundamental unit within __*Premise*__ is a __'moment'__ - a user-created
  piece of text, no more than 200 characters long, that are strung together to
  create an overall narrative. Each individual __moment__ may be a snippet of
  dialogue, exposition, description, narrative, etc.

__Moments__ are the individual nodes that form a __'story network'__ - an
  interconnected web of narratives. With a __story network__, each __moment__ has
  a single __'parent moment'__, and may have any number of __'child moments'__.
  In this way, __moments__ combine to create branching stories, in which the
  narrative can proceed in any number of directions at each step.

At the core of every __story network__ sits a central __'premise'__ - a set of
5 __moments__ connected in a ring. __Premises__ are designed to 'set the scene' for
a __story network__. For example, a __premise__ might:

* Describe the high-level geography and politics of a fictional world.
* Describe a murder scene.
* Introduce several characters, all gathered in a village pub.

A __premise__ thus creates a central concept or setting, from which any number
  of branching narratives may emerge. The individual narratives, in effect,
  create parallel universes in which the core concept remains the same, but
  every other element is up for grabs.
  
For example, the aforementioned 'murder scene premise' could have two different
  story branches that focused on entirely different motives. Or one could follow
  a single story branch all the way to the moment the mystery is solved, and
  then follow two diverging branches that named entirely different suspects!

## Using Premise

The core experience in __*Premise*__ involves starting at a moment in the central
  __premise__, and exploring/creating different story branches from there.

As the user encounters each __moment__, they are presented with four options:

* They may __'continue forward'__, which guides the user down the longest story
    branch from their current position. Defaulting to the longest branch serves
    to provide the longest narrative, and also selects for better-developed
    branches, which will tend to be higher-quality stories, and create a richer
    user journey.
* They may __'explore'__, which randomly selects a different following __moment__,
    instead of the default branch. This allows users to explore different
    narrative options. Initially, this choice will be random, but later versions
    of the app would allow for better-informed narrative recommendations, such as
    being based on user popularity, 'new branches', etc.
* They may __'create'__, contributing their own __moment__ and starting their own
    story branch for others to follow (and build upon).
* They may __'step backwards'__, moving back to the immediate __parent moment__,
    to either explore a different branch, or to begin creating their own branch.

### Reading view

The default user interface in __*Premise*__ will be the __'reading view'__, in
  which __moments__ appear sequentially and append to an overall storyline. This
  view is designed to provide as clean, quick, and smooth a reading experience
  as possible. It prioritizes a immersion in a single narrative over awareness
  of the user's location in the overall __story network__.
  
### Network view

The __'network view'__ shows how their current __moment__ fits within the larger
  __story network__, including how it traces back to the __central premise__,
  limited information about potential story branches going forward, and tracing
  other story branches the user has previously explored. Initially, this view
  will serve primarily for jumping from moment to moment. Down the line, this
  view may be used for highlighting popular or individually bookmarked
  __moments__, selecting and sharing story branches with other users.
