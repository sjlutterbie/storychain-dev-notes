# User journeys

As a user, I can **consume** or **create** content, and I can do so
**individually** or **socially**.

* __Consuming individually:__
  * I want to explore the narratives other users have created.
  * I want to follow a particular narrative across sessions, as it develops.
* __Consuming socially:__
  * I want to explore, rate, and discuss the narratives users have created.
  * I want to follow contributions by a particular user or users.
* __Creating individually:__
  * I want to use __*Premise*__ as a creative writing exercise.
  * I want to build my own `story chains`, independent of other users' ideas.
* __Creating socially:__
  * I want to participate in collaborative storytelling.
  * I want to create an invite-only `story network` for specific collaborators.
