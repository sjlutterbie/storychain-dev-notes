### Takeaways:

__Tutorial:__
1. Clarify user guide flow, OR move ToC to the end of the guide, so users
    are guided to click through the first time through.
2. Add page labels to Back/Next buttons in user guide.
3. Add 'Button reference' to 'Support' dropdown menu.
4. Add 'Create moment' button to end of `Story Chain`.
5. Change `Reading view` icon to be more indicative of a readable document.

### Raw notes

* Intended userguide flow not clear - user clicked straight to 'Central
    Premise', rather than 'Next button'.
* Didn't appear to noice userguide navigation arrows
  * _This may just be a side effect of paper testing_
  * Not clear to which pages arrows lead.
* End of instructions created clear expectations about entry point into app.
* Add instructional text underneath buttons?
  * _User didn't remember instructions from guide_
* Buttons are clear in `Create moment` interface.
* End of `story chain` needs a central `Create moment` button, as it's the only
  * navigational option, other than scrolling up.
* `Network view` nav button clear; `Story view` nav button not very clear.
  * _May be a side effect of paper testing_
* Create an interface reference page?
  * As a user, when I click the `?` menu item, I should see a dropdown that:
    * Gives me a link to the user guide
    * Displays a dropdown explaining what each button does.
