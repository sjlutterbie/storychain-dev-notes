### Takeaways

__Tutorial:__
1. The tutorial, while reportedly concise and helpful, may prove too long for
  a scrolling interface. Making numbered slides may prove effective... if I can
  keep the number of slides to a reasonable count.
2. Clarify the description of the `central premise`, and how the `moments` build it up.
3. Including graphics within the tutorial is very helpful!
4. The `? icon` should eventually include more extensive and in-depth resources. But,
    for the MVP, an easy-to-read tutorial is probably sufficient.

__Reading views:__
1. Rebuild the `reading view` to make reading a more seamless experience. Rather
    than separating each `moment`, keep them in one visual element, and use a
    hover effect to differentiate.
2. When the user clicks on a `moment`, THEN the action buttons can appear - 
    again, make them appear within the overall flow of the text.
3. When selecting a different `story chain`, it would be useful to include some
    intel regarding the potential branch: Length, popularity, etc.
4. Make it clearer how to switch between the two views. Having both buttons
    permanently visible, with the 'active' view highlighted, would clarify
    each button's meaning.
5. The `create moment` interface is intuitive. Stick with it, but present it
    within the overall flow of the narrative.

__Network view:__
1. Providing some indication of where unread `moments` exist, and the
    length/quality of the `story chains` behind them, would be helpful.
2. When you click on a `moment` in `network view`, it should load in `reading
    view`, with some or all of the 'backstory' pre-loaded. The selected `moment`
    could then be highlighted by displaying the action controls.

### Raw notes

* Instructions
  *  "5 moments in a loop..." text is unclear
    *  "Loop" implies directional narrative
  * Include the premise graphic earlier?
  *  Non-linear central premise is confusing
  * Interspersing graphics is helpful
  * Scroll vs. slideshow?
    * Numerated slides might provide clearer expectations
* Reading view
  * Wouldn't know which button to press
    * Arrow buttons don't work as icons, the geography isn't clear.
  * Minimum number of characters?
    * Optimum length of moments?
  * "Clean reading mode"
    * Remove borders between moments, let buttons appear when a moment's text
      is clicked
  * Make better use of scrolling interface
  * Provide intel on each branch before you follow it?
  * `Network view button` functionality not clear to user
    * Make different `mode buttons` always visible, highlight active mode.
  * `Create moment` interface seems intuitive
  * Make `Create moment` interface display inline, rather than in modal!
* Network view
  * Some type of intel or content preview would be helpful for each moment
  * Click on a moment, load some or all of its 'backstory', highlight current
      moment by displaying controls
  * More complete help options behind `? icon`?
