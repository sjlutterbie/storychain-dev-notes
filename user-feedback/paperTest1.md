### Raw notes

* Instructions
  *  - "5 moments in a loop..." text is unclear
    *  - "Loop" implies directional narrative
  * ? Include the premise graphic earlier?
  *  - Non-linear central premise is confusing
  * + Interspersing graphics is helpful
  * ? Scroll vs. slideshow?
    * Numerated slides might provide clearer expectations
* Reading view
  * - Wouldn't know which button to press
    * Arrow buttons don't work as icons, the geography isn't clear.
  * ? Minimum number of characters?
    * ? Optimum length of moments?
  * ! "Clean reading mode"
    * Remove borders between moments, let buttons appear when a moment's text
      is clicked
  * ! Make better use of scrolling interface
  * ? Provide intel on each branch before you follow it?
  * - `Network view button` functionality not clear to user
    * ! Make different `mode buttons` always visible, highlight active mode.
  * `Create moment` interface seems intuitive
  * ! Make `Create moment` interface display inline, rather than in modal!
* Network view
  * Some type of content intel/preview would be helpful for each moment
  * ! Click on a moment, load some or all of its 'backstory', highlight current
      moment by displaying controls
  * ? More complete help options behind `? icon`?
